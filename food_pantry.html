            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>To ensure members of the University of Michigan community—whether on a tight budget or physically
                restrained from getting to a grocery store—receive equitable access to healthy, nutritious, and
                nourishing food and the ability to prepare it for themselves or others. </p>
            <h3>Who We Are</h3>

                Cupboard is here to provide an immediate and comprehensive response for the U-M community. By offering
                resources, educational opportunities, compassionate support and more, we help students develop the
                skills to make informed decisions.</p>
