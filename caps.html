            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p><strong>Please Note:</strong> During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate
                class-related interviews
                and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our
                annual reports. </p>

            <p>The CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the
                confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone,
                which
                has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact us.
