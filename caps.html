                are
                inspired to help students realize their potential, cope with the stresses of life, work
                productively,

            <p> CAPS is committed to creating an environment based on our values of multicultural,
                multi-disciplinary
                and multi-theoretical practices that allow our diverse student body to access care, receive high
                quality
                services and take positive pathways to mental health. We are happy to offer both in-person and
